1. Game funcitonality

The player is first prompted to input a x and y coordinate to place his/her piece.
The coordinate is validated based on range and avaliablity.
After the player inputs the coordinates and places the piece, the computer generates random coordinates 
that will place the computer's piece on the board.

2. Additional Features

Implemented a feature that allows you to save the current match before each turn.
The methods for saving the board and reading the saved board from a file are written.
But did not have time to implement them in main.
